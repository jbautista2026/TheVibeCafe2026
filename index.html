        <h2>Rest and Rejuvenate</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Vibe Cafe, a place dedicated for wandering travelings such as yourself to unwind after a long (or short) journey.</p>
        <p>The Vibe Cafe is heavily inspired by Japanese culture. We pride ourselves not only in our beverages, but also in our various food items. Whether you like your coffee strong and bitter or mild and sweet, you're sure to find something you like here at the Vibe Cafe.</p>
        <p>Of course, the Vibe Cafe wouldn't be complete without background music. Though it usually plays some relaxing lofi tunes, customers may also request songs to be played in our radio system. We also have a section dedicated to manga and novels of all kinds.</p>
        <p>Convinced yet? Then come visit us over at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque New Mexico 87104. We patiently await your arrival.</p>

        <h3 class="DoTM_Name">"The Investigator's Katsudon"</h3>
        <p class="DoTM_Desc">A pork cutlet breaded and fried to golden perfection, topped with a special sauce and soft scrambled eggs. Despite having been cooked in the sauce and having eggs poured on top, the pork cutlet remains nice and crispy. Served on a bed of rice, the Investigator's Katsudon is sure to fill your stomachs with pure savory deliciousness. This dish was inspired by the signature dish of the character "Shikanoin Heizou" from Genshin Impact.</p>
        <p class="DoTM_Desc">Price: 300 PHP</p>
