        <p>Welcome to the Vibe Cafe's lounge! It's not much, but it's honest work. If you're here, then it could only mean one thing--You want to know more about the cafe! So, without further ado, how about we get started?</p>
        <p>If you look towards your right-hand side, you'll be able to find the Vibe Cafe's contact information. The Vibe Cafe is heavily inspired off of not only Japanese aesthetics, but also a video game known as "Genshin Impact." As a matter of fact, many of our drinks and food items are inspired from Genshin Impact. Our goal is to present a comfortable and easygoing atmosphere, and we here hope that becomes apparent as soon as you enter our establishment. We hope to see you here soon!</p>
